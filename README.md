Chris Tieman here, and thanks for stopping by. I‚Äôm a 30-something Developer, Designer, and proud father of 3 furry children located in the heart of Fishers, Indiana. It's also quite known by my friends that I have an unhealthy obsession with ducks.

I enjoy making apps, websites, and many other fun web tools. Creating things that both intrigue me and bring joy to others has been an increasingly worthwhile pursuit as my skills have grown.

Take a look around and stay for a while. Feel free to reach out to me anytime either on Github or through my website [https://christieman.com](https://christieman.com).

## üßë‚Äçüíª Projects I'm Proud Of

### ü¶ã [Daily Nook](https://daily-nook.web.app/)
When Animal Crossing first came out, I was hooked along with most of my friends. Being the completionist that I am, I had to make a tool for tracking active fish and bugs, as well as keeping track of what I've already caught.

### üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà [Debt Rainbow](https://debt-rainbow.web.app/)
This little tool was something I made for myself to track my student loan paydown progress üò≠. I really liked where it was headed, so I decided to hook it up to Firebase and share it with other people looking to pay off debt.

### üó° [OSRS Stats](https://rs.christieman.com/)
To anyone out there that enjoys Old School RuneScape (I know there has to be a few of you, right?) this one's for you. I went through a few nostalgia trips and decided to get back into RuneScape again with some coworkers and this was the result. We wanted to be able to compare our levels and see who was doing the best, and we got it.

### üéµ [Play Midnight](https://play-midnight.web.app/)
Play Midnight is an Extension for Chrome that injects JavaScript and CSS into the Google Music website in order to give users a way to create a custom look for Google Play Music. Play Midnight is retired now, since Google Music is no longer around.

### üëå [Scummy Poker](https://scummypoker.com/)
Take your agile/scrum backlog estimation to a whole new level. No more yelling out numbers or boring online card estimation. Now you can throw out your cards in style, and have fun while doing it.
